\specialchapt{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}
%!TEX root = ../dissertation.tex
A great deal of thanks is due to my major professors, Dr. Petru\c{t}a Caragea and Dr. Zhengyuan Zhu, for their guidance, insights, and dedication throughout the research and dissertation writing process. I was fortunate to be both formally taught by them on subjects including time series analysis and spatial statistics, and to be taught how to do research in statistics at a high level. Their encouragement of my work coupled with their consistent push to ask deeper questions and understand broad impacts have no doubt made me a better researcher. I would also like to thank my committee members for their advice and support: Dr. Heike Hofmann, Dr. Dan Nordman, and Dr. Stephen Vardeman. In particular, I would like to thank Dr. Stephen Vardeman for the many enjoyable conversations we have had over the past few years, including advice on academic life, efficient grocery shopping, and the nuances of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. 

Finally, I want to thank my friends in the statistics department and my family for their support and countless caffein-fueled conversations that helped me stay motivated throughout this journey.
