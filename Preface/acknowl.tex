%!TEX root = ../dissertation.tex
A great deal of thanks is due to my major professors, Dr. Petru\c{t}a Caragea and Dr. Zhengyuan Zhu, for their guidance, insights, and dedication throughout the research and dissertation writing process. I would also like to thank my committee members for their advice and support: Dr. Heike Hofmann, Dr. Dan Nordman, and Dr. Stephen Vardeman. In particular, I would like to thank Dr. Stephen Vardeman for the many enjoyable conversations we have had over the past few years including advice on academic life, efficient grocery shopping, and the nuances of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. 

I would also like to thank my friends in the statistics department and my family for their friendship and countless caffein-fueled conversations that helped me stay motivated throughout this journey.
