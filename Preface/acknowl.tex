\specialchapt{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}
%!TEX root = ../dissertation.tex
A great deal of thanks is due to my major professors, Dr. Petru\c{t}a Caragea and Dr. Zhengyuan Zhu, for their guidance and insights throughout the research and dissertation writing process. I was fortunate to receive their teaching in subjects including time series analysis and spatial statistics as well as high-level statistics research. Their encouragement of my work coupled with their consistent push to ask deeper questions and understand broad impacts have no doubt made me a better researcher. I would also like to thank my committee members for their advice and support. In particular, I would like to thank Dr. Stephen Vardeman for the many enjoyable conversations we have had over the past few years, including advice on academic life, efficient grocery shopping, and the nuances of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. 

Finally, I want to thank my parents, Mark and Karen, and my brother Matt. Your continual support and encouragement helped me stay motivated throughout this journey.
