Ph.D Dissertation, Iowa State University
========================================

This is my Ph.D dissertation in Statistics at Iowa State University. 

Project Organization
----------------------

Describe how the project is organized. Describe the contents of the folders, particularly where figures are located and how they can be reproduced.

TO DO
-----------------------
- I have not been able to set the graphics path using \graphicspath{} in the main tex file. It would be nice to get this to work.

- Need to check bibtex references and include any missing information

- One of the major problems with finalizing the dissertation is conforming to the margin guidelines. You should go through and make sure no tables or long equations entrude on the margins.

- Include a thorough theoretical background on Mercer's theorem and the Karhunen-Loeve theorem in the appendix.

- Figure out how to typeset special characters for names
